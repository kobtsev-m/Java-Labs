ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE, 
AND ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN MERELY PLAYERS, 
THEY HAVE THEIR EXITS AND ENTRANCES, 
AND ONE MAN IN HIS TIME PLAYS MANY PARTS, 
HIS ACTS BEING SEVEN AGES. AT FIRST THE INFANT, 
MEWLING AND PUKING IN THE NURSE'S ARMS. 
THEN, THE WHINING SCHOOLBOY WITH HIS SATCHEL 
AND SHINING MORNING FACE, CREEPING LIKE SNAIL 
UNWILLINGLY TO SCHOOL. AND THEN THE LOVER, 
SIGHING LIKE FURNACE, WITH A WOEFUL BALLAD 
MADE TO HIS MISTRESS' EYEBROW. THEN A SOLDIER, 
FULL OF STRANGE OATHS, AND BEARDED LIKE THE PARD, 
JEALOUS IN HONOUR, SUDDEN, AND QUICK IN QUARREL, 
SEEKING THE BUBBLE REPUTATION 
EVEN IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. AND THEN THE JUSTICE 
IN FAIR ROUND BELLY, WITH GOOD CAPON LIN'D, 
WITH EYES SEVERE, AND BEARD OF FORMAL CUT, 
FULL OF WISE SAWS, AND MODERN INSTANCES, 
AND SO HE PLAYS HIS PART. THE SIXTH AGE SHIFTS 
INTO THE LEAN AND SLIPPER'D PANTALOON, 
WITH SPECTACLES ON NOSE, AND POUCH ON SIDE, 
HIS YOUTHFUL HOSE WELL SAV'D, A WORLD TOO WIDE, 
FOR HIS SHRUNK SHANK, AND HIS BIG MANLY VOICE, 
TURNING AGAIN TOWARDS CHILDISH TREBLE, PIPES 
AND WHISTLES IN HIS SOUND. LAST SCENE OF ALL, 
THAT ENDS THIS STRANGE EVENTFUL HISTORY, 
IS SECOND CHILDISHNESS AND MERE OBLIVION, 
SANS TEETH, SANS EYES, SANS TASTE, SANS EVERYTHING.
